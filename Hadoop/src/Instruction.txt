Working :

 
1.  make simple (.txt) file  and inside the file  put some Entry in terms of document  Id .and    then   give each doc  different ID.  
Example: 
Doc[0] = "i am jagpreet singh thakur" 
Doc[1] = "who is he" 
Doc[2] = "he is mukul" 
 
   
2. We put that file into Hadoop dir . // command -> ./Hadoop fs -put <host file path> <hadoop dir path> 
 
3. After that goto eclipse and make new (.jar) File  . 
 
4. finally  put aeverything with (.jar) file in to hdfs and run  our programme  // command  Hadoop jar  <.jar file path>  Class Name <Hadoop dir path where input file is present> <Hadoop dir path where we should store our output>. 
5. After applying the Indexing algorithm, we get  Like OUTPUT(Demo) 

 
 Doc[1]  Doc[2]  Doc[0]  
"he Doc[2]  
"i Doc[0]  
"who Doc[1]  
am Doc[0]  
he" Doc[1]  
is Doc[1]  Doc[2]  
jagpreet Doc[0]  
mukul" Doc[2]  
singh Doc[0]  
thakur" Doc[0]  
 
Where  "a": {3} implies the term "a" appears in the Doc[3] file. Similarly, "is": Doc[1]  Doc[2]  implies the term "is" appears in the files Doc[1] and Doc[2].
